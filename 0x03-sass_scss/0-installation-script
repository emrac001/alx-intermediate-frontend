Steps I took to install SASS:

1. Navigated into the repository folder from my windows command line:
   cd alx-intermediate-frontend

2. Created a new directory for the SASS project and navigated into it:
   mkdir 0x03-sass_scss
   cd 0x03-sass_scss

3. Made sure Node.js and npm are installed on my system.
   node -v **output** v24.7.0
   npm -v **output** 11.5.1

4. Installed SASS (latest version) using npm:
   npm install sass

5. Verified the installation:
   npx sass --version **output** 1.92.1 compiled with dart2js 3.9.2
